    "content" : "# Demo Summary\n\nThe demo contains all types of levels to demonstrate the training capabilities of the KYPO Cyber Range Platform.\n\n| Level | Level Name | Level Type |\n|:------:|------| ------ |\n| 1. | Info | Info |\n| 2. | Finding Open Ports | Game |\n| 3. | Connecting via Telnet | Game |\n| 4. | Privilege Escalation | Game |\n| 5. | Test Example | Assessment |\n| 6. | Assessment Example | Assessment |\n\n## Info\n\nThe level contains this information page.\n\n## Finding open ports\n\nThe level provides information on how to connect to a sandbox. In general, there are two possible approaches. The first approach is to use the platform'a GUI to connect to the machine via Spice console. The second approach is to connect through SSH with a generated config file and keys.\n\nThis level's small challenge is to scan open ports.\n\n## Connecting Via Telnet\n\nThis level's challenge is to connect to the server machine without a password and discover the secret flag.\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nThis demo's bigger challenge is to gain root privileges and read a flag available only to a root user. Enjoy! \n\n## Test Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. Tests can be used, for example, for additional testing of students for grading purposes.\n\n## Assessment Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. For example, the tests can be used to verify the learning outcomes or for collecting feedback.\n"

    "content" : "Your goal is to get access to a **server**. You know that there is a **telnet** service running on the server but it is not running on the default port. Your first task is to find the **port** on which the telnet service is running. The flag is the port number.\n\nBelow are two options how to connect to the client from which you can connect to the server.\n\n## GUI access\n1. In the topology overview, click the button in the top-right corner of the graph, then **`Expand All`**, **`client`** and **`Generate console URL`**. After a few moments, **`Open link`** next to the **`Generate console URL`** should appear.\n\n2. Login using username **`kypo`** and password **`kypo`**.\n\n## SSH from local machine\n1. Use the **`Get SSH Access`** button to download **`ssh-access.zip`**.\n\n2. Extract the **`ssh-access.zip`** file to your **`~/.ssh/`** directory.\n\n    `$ unzip ssh-access.zip -d ~/.ssh/`\n\n3. Execute the extracted source script in the current shell using the **`source`** command with the path to the KYPO proxy SSH private key. The source script that will set the **`ssh`** command and the **KYPO proxy SSH private key**, which is available from instance operator.\n\n    `$ source ~/.ssh/pool-id-<pool_ID>-sandbox-id-<sbx_ID>-user-source.sh PATH_TO_KYPO_PROXY_PRIVATE_KEY`\n\n4. Connect to the client to **`kypo`** user. \n\n    `$ ssh kypo@client`",

You can see **ssh** running on port **22** and some other service running on port **2323**. This has to be the **telnet** service.\n\n3. Enter **`2323`** as the flag.",
